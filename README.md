# Personality Quiz

Brief Project Description:
The website will provide several personality quizzes on the home page. In order for the user to access the home page they will be required to either create a new account or simply sign in with an existing account that is already made and stored on the website's storage database. Once, the user logs in then they can pick any of the quizzes that are provided. The quizzes that are provided will have a set of questions that will be required for the user to answer to get a better understanding of their personality. After the user submits their answer they will then be taken to a result page that will show what character, icon, music, artist, ect. that share similarities to their personality. If the user is satisfied with their result then they can share the URL with their result and/or choose to save their result to their account/profile. The navigation bar will be the same throughout any page browsed through the website in which it will have the website logo, title, profile page link, and a sign out button. The logo and website title is a clickable link for the user that will take them to the homepage. The home page will also provide two buttons called Create and Browse which will take the user to separate pages.
